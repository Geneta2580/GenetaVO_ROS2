[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:25 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findsuitesparse.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "suitesparse", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "suitesparse" with
  any of the following names:

    suitesparseConfig.cmake
    suitesparse-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "suitesparse" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "suitesparse_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "suitesparse" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
